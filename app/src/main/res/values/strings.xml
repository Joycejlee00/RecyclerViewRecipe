        <item>This recipe is from my mother-in-law Kris, who got it from her mom. Kris told me this a while ago after re-reading the post, “I read all the comments on this soup, and I have to say I got a little teary eyed thinking about how well received my mother’s delicious soup has been, and how many families now love it and consider it a favorite!"</item>
        <item>You would not believe how easy and tasty this recipe is! Poor little Brussels sprouts often get a bad rap (I used to hate them) but that’s because people don’t know the secret about roasting. It takes them from “this smells like feet” to “Oh my goodness I’m going to eat this whole pan single handedly.”</item>
        <item>A simple overnight marinade and an hour or two of roasting is all you need to get THAT CRUST. Make Cubanos (Cuban Sandwiches) with the leftovers.</item>
